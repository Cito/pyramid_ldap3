0.3.1
-----

- Since ldap3 version 2.0.7, schema information is loaded from the server on
  every connection. This is normally not needed for authentication and slows
  down the connections, so we now disable this feature. If you fetch user or
  group attributes and want them to be properly formatted, you must enable this
  feature by setting get_info to 'SCHEMA' or 'ALL' when calling ldap_setup().
